# BounceSMP Companion Mod

A collection of various fixes to improve the [BounceSMP modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/bouncesmp-public) experience.

## Fixes

### Server

- Adds gamerule `creeperNoBlowyBlocks` to prevent mob griefing from specifically explosions (creeper, ghast, wither, ravager).
- Prevents curse enchantments from the Mantori mod from being applied when using the Biome Makeover altar, because they are actually beneficial.
- Lets all jobs select the Extractinator block.
- Adds some missing blocks to Extractinator loot pools.[^1]
- Fixes Tiered reforging.

[^1]: Adds the following blocks to the Extractinator loot pools:
  Cobblestone, Gravel, Tuff, and Smooth Basalt

### Client

- Improves [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) & [EMI Loot](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi-loot) support for the modpack.[^2]
- Improves [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) support for the modpack.[^3][^4]
- Adds translations for missing keys such as Custom Portal API's portal block name and enchantment descriptions for Mantori & Magna enchantments.

[^2]: Adds [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) support for the following mods:
  Extractinator, Tiered, Origins, Numismatic Overhaul, Tokenable Furnaces, and Chipped
[^3]: Adds [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) support for the following mods:
  Tiered
[^4]: REI does not support showing Origins job-locked recipes, it is therefore recommended to use [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) instead.

## License

This mod blatantly disregards several mods' licenses. I don't care.
