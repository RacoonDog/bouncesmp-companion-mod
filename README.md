# BounceSMP Companion Mod

A collection of various fixes to improve the [BounceSMP modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/bouncesmp-public) experience.

## Fixes

### Server

- Added gamerule `creeperNoBlowyBlocks` to prevent mob griefing from specifically explosions (creeper, ghast, wither, ravager).
- Prevent curse enchantments from the Mantori mod from being applied when using the Biome Makeover altar, because they are actually beneficial.

### Client

- Added [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) support for Extractinator recipes.
- Added translations for missing keys such as Custom Portal API's portal block name and enchantment descriptions for Mantori enchantments.

## License

This mod blatantly disregards several mods' licenses. I don't care.
